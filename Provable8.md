Word-By-Document Matrix

The \(i\)-th row, $j$-th column is the relative frequency of word i in document j.


$M = A W,  M \in \mathbb{R}^{m, n}, A \in \mathbb{R}^{m, r}, W \in \mathbb{R}^{r, n}$



log-rank conjecture: the deterministic communication complexity of a two-party Boolean function is polynomially related to the logarithm of the rank of its input matrix.
